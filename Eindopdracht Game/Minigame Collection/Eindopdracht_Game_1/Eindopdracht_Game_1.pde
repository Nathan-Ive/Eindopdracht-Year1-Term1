//For chapter 13 I have to make a self-decided task. 
//I want to make a small game collection.


///Each of these games or features are a part of what I want to impliment into a future game.

//This first game I'll be making will make a random letter show up on the middle of the screen the point is to press it as many times as possible. 
//From this framework I will work up, having the button change after x amount of inputs, having the button change after x amount of seconds. 
//The final result and hardest minigame asking you to type a set of themed words as many times as you can within a set amount of time.
//My assumption with making this one first is that this is the second easiest game to make out of the five ideas I have thought up.
//The easiest game is just a reaction based game that asks you to press a button at the right time, basically a QTE, nothing too special I think.

//The second game uses the mouse instead, requiring you to stay within a specific zone for a certain amount of time. Harder versions make the zone smaller.
//The hardest version of this game will require you to click within zones that pop up for x amount of seconds before they dissapear.

//The third game has you collecting as many objects as possible within x amount of seconds. 
//This one doesn't have an alternative harder version, just more demanding requirements where you have to collect more objects within that given timeframe.

//The fourth and final game includes games that have you competing against an CPU for more wins, the main feature should be knowing when the player loses, wins or ties with the CPU opponent.
//Harder versions would just have you facing an AI that increases in difficulty faster, or limit the amount of times you can fail before a loss happens.

//That would be my final game, but not my final feature. After completing these four games I want to make a menu that lets you select which one of the four you want to play, and which difficulty you want to play if it has that.
//The menu is the least important thing, which is why I am doing it last.
